An opinionated server toolkit for ReasonML on Node.js.

- Written to run on Node.js (11+ is best).
- Includes modules for connecting to and querying Postgres.
- Includes a logging module that automatically adds request-ids to all logs written during the life of a request.
- Wraps bs-express, and thus Express.js.
- Works with existing express middleware.
- Offers a compositional and strongly typed approach to middleware and handler composition.
- Development and design driven by real-world needs at Bloom Built (Day One).
- Needs documentation :)
